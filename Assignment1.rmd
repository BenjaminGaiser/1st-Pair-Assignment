# Introduction

In this assignment we draw two data sets from the GitHub repository [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight) and apply some descriptive statistics on them.[^footnote1] If you have set this file up correctly your working directory should appear here:


```{r show working directory, echo = FALSE}
getwd()
```

# Data Set 1: Police Killings

The first data set we choose is about police killings in the US which was gathered by the Guardian. Information on the structure of the raw data set can be accessed on [GitHub: fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/police-killings). FiveThirtyEight wrote themselves about it on their [website](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-police-have-killed-americans-in-2015/) and the corresponding Guardian story is available on [The counted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database). What fallows are our own descriptive statistics of the data set.

# Data Set 2: US Birth Statistics

This is boxplot 1:

```{r plot1, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(births$births~births$month, col=topo.colors(12), xlab = "Month", ylab = "Births")
```

This is No 2:

```{r plot2, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(births$births~births$day_of_week, col=topo.colors(7), xlab = "Day of Week", ylab = "Births")
```

Here comes the heatmap:

```{r heatmap, echo=FALSE}
heatmap.2(mat, main = "Births on Weekdays per Month", density.info = "none", trace = "none", dendrogram = "none", Rowv = NA, Colv = NA)
```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
