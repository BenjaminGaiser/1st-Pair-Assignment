##Problem to Solve
The [first assignment](https://github.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures/blob/master/README.md) reads as follows:
>The first pair assignment is designed to develop your understanding of file structures, version control, and basic R data structures and descriptive statistics. Each pair will create a new public GitHub repository. The repository should be fully documented, including with a descriptive README.md file. The repository will include R source code files that access at least two data sets from the R core data sets and/or fivethirtyeight, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety relevant of descriptive statistics. At least one file must dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. Finally, another pair must make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged. Deadline 7 October, 10% of final grade.
