# 1st Pair Assignment by Alex & Torben
## Overview
This is the repository to solve the first assignment in the [MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis](https://github.com/HertieDataScience) course of the fall semester 2016. It is authored by [Alex](https://github.com/corrod3) and [Torben](https://github.com/torbatschow). Any feedback, comments, and ideas are highly appreciated. Please send them to <a href="mailto:t.klausa@mpp.hertie-school.org">Torben</a> or <a href="mailto:a.sacharow@mpp.hertie-school.org">Alex</a> or submit a pull request.

## Structure of the Repository
The repository contains R scripts for getting and cleaning the data ([getData.R](https://github.com/torbatschow/1st-Pair-Assignment/blob/master/getData.R)), a script for the plots [stats+Graphics.R](https://github.com/torbatschow/1st-Pair-Assignment/blob/master/stats%2BGraphics.R) and a separate rmd script to analyse/present the data ([Assignment1.rmd](https://github.com/torbatschow/1st-Pair-Assignment/blob/master/Assignment1.rmd)).
The [pdf version of the final document](https://github.com/torbatschow/1st-Pair-Assignment/blob/master/Assignment1.pdf) in this repository should be treated with care as it might not contain the latest changes made in the scripts.

## Problem to Solve
The [first assignment](https://github.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures/blob/master/README.md) reads as follows:
>The first pair assignment is designed to develop your understanding of file structures, version control, and basic R data structures and descriptive statistics. Each pair will create a new public GitHub repository. The repository should be fully documented, including with a descriptive README.md file. The repository will include R source code files that access at least two data sets from the R core data sets and/or fivethirtyeight, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety relevant of descriptive statistics. At least one file must dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. Finally, another pair must make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged. Deadline 7 October, 10% of final grade.
